What is cloud?
You can access the data/application via the internet at any time in anyway.

What is cloud computing?
Cloud Computing is the delivery of computing services like Servers, Storage, Database, 
Networking and software.

It is the processing of accessing the data or application via the internet
Ex:- Facebook, Youtube, Instagram

Types of cloud computing

Cloud Computing
1) Service Model
-> SAAS (software as a service)
-> PAAS (platform as a service)
-> IAAS (infrastructure as a service)

2) Deployment Model
-> Private Cloud
-> Public Cloud
-> Hybrid Cloud
-> Community Cloud

1) Service Model

software as a service
Managed by vendor
-> Applications
-> Data
-> Runtime
-> Middleware
-> OS
-> Virtualization
-> Servers
-> Storage
-> Networking
Ex:-Gmail

platform as a service
Managed by vendor
-> Runtime
-> Middleware
-> OS
-> Virtualization
-> Servers
-> Storage
-> Networking
Ex:- Heroku,Google App Engine,OCP,Godaddy and Microsoft Azure App Service

infrastructure as a service
Managed by vendor
-> Virtualization
-> Servers
-> Storage
-> Networking
Ex:- AWS,AZURE,GCP

2) Deployment Model

Public Cloud
-> Public Cloud is open to all to store and access information via the internet.
-> Public clouds are managed by third parties.
-> In public cloud, security will be less when we compared to private and hybrid.

Private Cloud
-> A private cloud is also known as an internal cloud or corporate cloud.
-> It is used by organizations to build and manage their data centers.
-> In private cloud security will be high.

Hybrid Cloud
-> Hybrid cloud is the combination of both public cloud and private cloud.
-> if the services are running on public then it will not have much security.
-> if the services are running on private then the cloud have high security.

community cloud
-> it allows multiple organizations to use same cloud to store their data.

Cloud Providers
AWS,AZURE,GCP,IBM .... etc

what is AWS?

-> AWS is abbreviated as Amazon Web Services.
-> It is the best cloud provider.
-> It is the first among all the clouds.
-> It offers multiple services on different domains.
-> It is the combination of SAAS,PAAS,IAAS
-> It is one of the most cloud computing platform. Now a days most
of the companies are using this cloud because of numerous that allow
them to store their data easily without the need for a physical space.

why aws is so popular?

-> AWS provides a wide range of cloud computing services that can be used
to build and run applications.
-> It can offer 200+ services on multiple domains.
A group of availability zones is called region.
-> AWS covers about 31 geographic regions around the world.
-> AWS provides a wide range of security features to store their applications and data in the cloud.
-> AWS allows users to select different operating systems, databases and languages
-> It follows the Pay as you go, Model.


Advantages of AWS

-> Automated MultiRegion Backup's
-> Streamlined Disaster Recovery
-> Security
-> Pay as you go pricing
-> Simple Automated Scheduling
-> Customization
-> Third Party API's
-> Speed and Agility
-> Excellent customer support
